This document is about how should we represent data in a Readme file. It must contain a picture, picture, hypertexts and tables. I have put the logo on the top right corner of the page.
A link to my github profile is also attached https://github.com/Zeeshanalik/test-repository.git.
Below this are some snippets of code from github:
	
	git status
	git commit –m “type your commit here”
